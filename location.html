        <h2>Cancun, Mexico</h2>
        <p>Cancun has been a go to vacation destination for my family and I. We've been here multiple times.</p>
        <p>Everytime we go here it is just a blast, we usually will stay in an all inclusive hotel where food and beverages are included.</p>
        <p>This trip usually conists of going on different excursions which are kind of like amusement parks.</p>
        <p>This destination is for sure the funnest out of all the places I've been because of all the different adrenaline inducing adventures as well as the drinking age is lowered in Mexico which made it more fun.</p>
        <p>Below are some things that we did while there.</p>
        <ol>
         <li>Swimming with Sharks</li>
          <li>Zip Linning</li>
          <li>Visisted Pyramids</li>
          <li>Went to see the Zenotes</li>
          <li>Visited Xcaret, Xplor Fuego, Xenses, Xel-Ha(All themeparks with different activities)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Will be going back there soon, possibly this year because of how amazing the scenary is in Cancun, Mexico and because my family is from there we feel comfortable being around spanish speaking locals.</p>

      <div class="caboinfo">
        <h2>Los Cabos, Mexico</h2>
        <p>This was the most recent trip. Another part of Mexico. Los Cabos is located under California.</p>
        <p>I remember this the best as it was the most recent trip I've been to. This was more of a relaxing experiece compared to Cancun</p>
        <p>Instead of all the themeparks and exploration, this trip consisted of site seeing, enjoying the culture there and a rented yacht that took us to see the famous strucuture in Cancun and whales</p>
        <p> To the right are just some pictures taken by me during our trip there</p>

        <h2>Inside the Country Trips</h2>
        <p>Inside the USA I've been to Orlando, Florida | Las Vegas, Nevada | Niagra Falls, New York</p>
        <p>Las Vegas was the most boring trip I've ever taken. Due to the fact that I was about 14 years old and couldn't do anything there.</p>
        <p>So theres not much content from there apart from site seeing and exploring the strip walking</p>
        <p>In Orlando we went to experience the Disney World Parks and Universal Studios.</p>
        <p>We visised the following parks</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Magic Kingdom</li>
          <li>Hollywood Studios</li>
          <li>Univseral Studios</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here are some pictures from my trip to Florida</p>
