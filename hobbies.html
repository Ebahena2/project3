        <h2>Soccer</h2>
        <p>Since I was young, I've always enjoyed playing and watching soccer. I would say it's my favorite sport.</p>
        <p>The team I support is Fc Barcelona, I think watching that 2009 team made me want to support them. </p>
        <p>I've played since I was young but due to bad knees and ankles I wasn't able to continue as I would always get injured while playing</p>
        <p>But I tune into any match that is on because I just enjoy watching the sport and play it whenever I can</p>
        <p>Here are some of the best goals scored by Barcelona</p>

      <h2>Video Games</h2>
      <p>Gaming is also a hobby I enjoy. I was exposed to gaming from young because my sister had a nintendo 64. Ever since then I've just enjoyed gaming</p>
      <p>Not to big of a fan of single player game, but I have played The Last of Us and God of War. But other than that I don't like playing single player games</p>
      <p>I'm a big fan of FPS games such as COD, CSGO, Valorant, games like this. I'd say I'm pretty good at all those</p>
